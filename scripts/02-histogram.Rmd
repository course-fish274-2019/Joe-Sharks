SharkAttackdata <- read.csv("../data/SharkAttackdata.csv")
```



I made a frequency table of water areas but no matter what I try I get an error message of "Error: StatBin requires a continuous x variable: the x variable is discrete. Perhaps you want stat="count”?”

ggplot(Water_area_freq,aes(x=water_area)) +

 geom_histogram()
 
 
```{r}
wa_count <- count(SharkAttackdata, water_area)
head(wa_count)
```

 
 

```{r}
ggplot(wa_count, aes(x = n)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```
