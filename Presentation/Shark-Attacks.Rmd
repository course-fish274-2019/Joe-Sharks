## My Shark Attack Data

- shark attack data around the world
- between the years of 1960 - 2015
- 2257 observations

```{r, include = FALSE}


#loading packages to use

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


```


![](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/00/57/20/16970768/7/gallery_medium.jpg)

```{r, include = FALSE}
# I inserted my shark attack data by using read.csv and used the include = FALSE function so it would not show up on my slides after I knit it 

SharkAttackdata <- read.csv("../data/SharkAttackdata.csv")

```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# I used echo = FALSE so that the code would not show up when I did not want it to and include = FALSE so that it would not show up this time 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)
```

## Shark Attack Data
- the data included the water area, continent, country, state, and county, and year 
```{r}
# i used knitr kable function to show the first five values of my shark attack data table in a more aestetically pleasing way
knitr::kable(
  SharkAttackdata [1:5, ], 
  caption = "Shark Attack Data")

```

## Barplot with Year and Frequency
- Generally speaking, I wanted to see if shark attacks had been rising significantly 
- From the data you can see there has been a steady increase over time of shark attacks 
```{r}
# I used ggplot to create a frequency barplot and got help from the grad students to make the appropriate ticks in the axis that were consistant 
ggplot(SharkAttackdata, aes(year)) +
  geom_bar(fill="light blue") + 
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme(legend.direction = "vertical") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  scale_x_continuous( breaks=pretty(SharkAttackdata$year))
```

## Barplot with Continent and Frequency

- North America had the most Shark Attacks
- over 1200 attacks reported in this data
- averages over 21 attacks/year since 1960

```{r}
# I inserted the bar graph i made last week

ggplot(SharkAttackdata, aes(continent),color = blue) +
  geom_bar(fill="light blue") +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme(legend.direction = "vertical") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))
```


## Barplot of Shark Attacks in the USA 
- I decided to look at the USA for shark attacks
- I filtered by country, and looked at the US
- Florida had the highest shark attacks out of any state 

```{r}
# filtering data by country (USA) and then making a bar plot organized by state

USdata <- filter(SharkAttackdata, country == "USA")

ggplot(USdata, aes(state)) +
  geom_bar(fill="light blue") + 
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme(legend.direction = "vertical") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

## Barplot of Shark Attacks in Florida
- I then was interested in what parts of Florida
- I myself frequent there with my family and was genuinely curious so I filtered again by state
- I graphed by county which is shown
```{r}

#taking the data I just filtered and filtering it again to just get the florida data organized by county
Floridaadata <- filter(USdata, state == "Florida")


ggplot(Floridaadata, aes(county)) +
  geom_bar(fill="light blue") + 
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme(legend.direction = "vertical") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))



```



## So ... Don't go to Volusia County, FL and go swimming with the sharkies !
