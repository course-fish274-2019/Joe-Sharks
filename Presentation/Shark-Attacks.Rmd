## My Shark Attack Data
- shark attack data around the world
- between the years of 1960 - 2015
- 2257 observations


![shark](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/00/57/20/16970768/7/gallery_medium.jpg)

```{r, include = FALSE}
# I inserted my shark attack data by using read.csv and used the include = FALSE function so it would not show up on my slides after I knit it 

SharkAttackdata <- read.csv("../data/SharkAttackdata.csv")

```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# I used echo = FALSE so that the code would not show up when I did not want it to and include = FALSE so that it would not show up this time 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)
```

## Shark Attack Data
```{r}
# i used knitr kable function to show the first five values of my shark attack data table in a more aestetically pleasing way
knitr::kable(
  SharkAttackdata [1:5, ], 
  caption = "A knitr kable.")

```

## Barplot with Continent and Frequency
```{r}
# I loaded ggplot and then inserted the bar graph i made last week 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(SharkAttackdata, aes(continent)) +
  geom_bar() +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme(legend.direction = "vertical") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))
```
