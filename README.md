# Joe-Sharks
General Idea for Project:

In this project I plan to explore the question of: Do shark attacks increase over time (hope to answer this in the coming weeks) ? Where do shark attack occur most frequently (already answered this) I am using the data I have about shark attacks from 1960-2015.

I will hopefully be able to group the general geographical location within each year and see if there is a trend

Project Purpose: To create a final project for fish 274 course. More specifically, I hope to look at certain variables within a shark attack data set.

Packages used: Dplyr, ggplot2 

Files in order of use:

scripts/dataimport1.Rmd -- The .Rmd of my project so far with the code and one barplot

presentations/Shark-Attacks.Rmd -- week 9 presenation for quiz (5 slides, 1 image, 1 gif, 1 bar plot)
