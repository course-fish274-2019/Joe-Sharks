# Joe-Sharks
General Idea for Project:

In this project I plan to explore the question of: Do shark attacks increase over time? Where do shark attack occur most frequently. I am using the data I have about shark attacks from 1960-2015.

Project Purpose: To create a final project for fish 274 course. More specifically, I hope to look at certain variables within a shark attack data set.
